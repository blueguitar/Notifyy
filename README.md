# Notify App

### Some of the cool stuff I'll be integrating in this project:
1. Data Binding
2. UI layout design using ConstraintLayout
3. App Navigation -- Using multiple fragments and conditional navigation
4. Activity & Fragment Lifecycle
5. Architecture Components:
    1. Combining Viewmodels and Livedata
    2. Data persistence using **Room**
6. RecyclerView -- to is efficiently reuse views
7. Improve app performance with Kotlin coroutines

#### About the app 
User is able to :
1. View notes created
2. Search for a note
3. Create or edit and save a note
4. Share and Delete a note
